Call chains (generated by `scripts/call_chains.py`)

Flow:
```
display_tty->tty
fuzz_stb_image->net,persist
game->collision,direction,persist,rng
render->display_tty,persist,platform,render_3d,render_input
render_3d->camera,env,projection,raycast,render_3d_sdl,sprite,texture
snakegame->console,game,input,persist,platform,render,render_3d,tty
sprite->camera,projection,render_3d_sdl
test_persist_long_lines->persist
test_tty_path->collision,console,env,input,net,persist,render_input,snakegame,test_persist_long_lines,texture,tty
```

Tree(main):
```
(see `scripts/out/call_chains_out.txt` for full tree)
```

Notes:
- The main flow shows `fuzz_stb_image` touching `net` and `persist` modules, which is useful to trace input->sink call paths.
- `persist_read_scores` and `persist_load_config` appear in the `main` call tree and are reachable from run paths that handle user input and game state.
- Recommend reviewing the call paths marked above for additional hardening or targeted tests.
